This is an implementation of wide residual networks (https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07146) using only PyTorch.

Wide residual networks (WRNs) see an improvement in accuracy by increasing in the "width" of the network instead of its "depth". WRN is efficient to train because it is shallow, and common gradient issues can be avoided.
